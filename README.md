## Inroduction

In this technological era of education and doing business, information is considerd to be an important asset for any academic institution.The availability of student data and feedback can help an educational institution to align its business processes according to the needs of
its students and stakeholders.The effective management of these data can help institutions reach out directly to their students and stakeholders
and also to streamline its activities.Commitment towards the succss of students of higher education can be achieved through innovations such as flexible
scheduling,continuous enrollment,a university-wide academic social network,,online classes,a digital library,computer stimulations and online student registration
as well.This innovative approach helps pioneer many of the conviniences of students a kind of education that is reach-prooven to be just as effective conventional
instruction.At Zetech Unversity,just like the other universities, students are enrolled to pursue their academic degree,diploma and certificate program. Students
must pass and obtain the minimum university admission requirements in order toÂ qualify for admission.An enrolled student is expected to register and pay either
full or part of the school fees before he/she can take courses every semester.In most cases, enrolling and having to register every semester involves both manual
and online processes which sometimes delays the  processes for both the university and more especially the students, since the students are required to go to the
university and take some forms which they are required to fill and take them back to the university for them to be admitted.Student registration is done through
an online platform though a student still needs to go to the university to take some forms, making this system a semi-automated.
